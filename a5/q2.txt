The weeping angels are in a deadlock, while I think it can be a livelock.
For angels to move, the lock "no one is looking" must be available. As soon as the lock is unavailable, the angels
 will be block and cannot continue moving.
This is the scenario at the climax: angels A, B, C , and D are looking at each other, forming a chain, where
    1. A looks at B;
    2. B looks at C;
    3. C looks at D;
    4. D looks at A.
Since every angel has another angel looking at it, no angel can move. This situation is a deadlock, because
 for an angel X to move, the other angel Y who is looking at X need to move first so that Y can move its
 eyesight from X. However, Y is unable to move as it requires another angel to move first, which will eventually
 form a chain of prerequisits: A requires D requires C requires B requires A. Hence, it is a deadlock as every
 angel is waiting for the move of another angel, who is also waiting for the move of the former angel.

However, with assistance outside angels, I think the situation can be a livelock. For example, if one of the
 two character stands in front of an angel, say A, blocking the eyesight of the A. Then, B will be able to move
 as A now is not looking at it; the lock "no one is looking" is released by the character blocking the eyesight
 of A. Now the lock is broken and hence it is a livelock with the help of another character.
